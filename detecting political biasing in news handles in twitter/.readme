What is Political Biasing ? Political biasing is basically a bias or perceived bias of an news organisations which involves the altering of information to make a political position or political candidates seem more attractive .

My objective is to help the people to look at the quantification of the neutrality claimed by news handles. Thus the people can easily analyse the results and decide which news handle they would like to follow.

In this project , I will present an analytical model which quantifies the biasness of a news handles towards a political party by mining and analyzing tweets of news handles in present scenario.
