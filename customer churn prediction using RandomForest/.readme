I used a function dropna() to drop the rows with null values for the purpose to data cleaning. After that ,one the the most important tasks was feature selection.For that I used correlation matrix . What I did was first i used labelEncoder() function in preprocessing to convert the categorical data. The with the help of corr() function I founded the correlation between all the features and churn.With the help of this I got the least important features also which I dropped from the dataset.Same way I got the variables to be selected such as - Contract , techsupport ,tenure etc. as the had the highest correlation with churn.

RandomForestClassfier was used as I found it most suitable for this case .Took estimators 100 and data splitting done according to the splitting asked in the assignment.
